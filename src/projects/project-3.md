Futurity is a digital time capsule where you can record a voice message and schedule it to be sent to you 1, 2 or 3 years in the future. Once the message has been recieved the audio file is deleted from the server and you own the only digital copy of it. Built using next.js with a custom express server and a couple of external services for storing files and the mongodb database. Check back soon to see a live preview!
