MazeGame is the first out of three projects I finished for my studies at the Ironhack web development bootcamp. Get the "spaceship" through the maze. Touching the walls results in game over. Each part of the map has it's own obstacles. Some of them are not visible until you reach that part of the level. There are 3 difficulties and 3 cheat codes. Created using Javascript and Html5 Canvas.
